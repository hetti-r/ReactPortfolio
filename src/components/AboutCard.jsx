                    <p>Iâ€™m a screenwriter & game developer based in Helsinki, Finland. I'm currently studyin full-stack development in Business College Helsinki. I love everything games and animation related and these interests have led me to work on various projects during the years. <br /><br />I appreciate working with all kinds of people and I have an ability to see the different strengths people posses. I'm good at team building and I tend to encourage and inspire other people. While working in a team I'm also keen on open dialogue and transparency. <br /><br />My current goal is to learn professional level coding skills in web development. I'm also making a progress in narrative game design and creating a visual style.</p>
