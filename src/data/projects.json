    "longDescription": "This project was done as a part of my studies in React and Drupal course at Business College Helsinki. The task was to renew a  company website in collaboration with Druid Oy to meet their specific requirements. We integrated Drupal as the backend and React.js as the frontend.\nThis project demonstrates an interaction between these technologies, where Drupal handles content management, and React provides a dynamic front-end interface using JSON. The communication between the two platforms is facilitated through JSON:API.\nThe website was made as a group project with four other students. My role in the project was to design the website and make a prototype in Figma, create the React frontend, and to make the website responsive. The project was done in two months.",
