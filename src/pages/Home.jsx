            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m a screenwriter & game developer based in Helsinki, Finland. I'm currently studying full-stack development in Business College Helsinki. I love everything games and animation related and these interests have led me to work on various projects during the years. I appreciate working with all kinds of people and I have an ability to see the different strengths people possess. I'm good at team building. I tend to encourage and inspire other people. While working in a team I'm also keen on open dialogue and transparency. My current goal is to acquire professional-level coding skills in web development. I'm also making progress in narrative game design and creating a visual style.
